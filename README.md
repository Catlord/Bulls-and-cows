Bulls and Cows

No Problems in there just sharing my job on that heavy part of C++. 

Coming from PHP (assuming they are not doing the same things), C++ has a very more simple structure by me, 
but it is much more difficult to implement. 
It is a very precise language and I hope I will be able to be confident with it very soon :p. 

I am a little bit frightened, at the moment, by performance objective that is needed, to package a suitable application using VR or very hungry applications.
I will probably have more time on the code to be sure I am understanding what's going on in there.
